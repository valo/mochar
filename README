== Introduction

This is a simple online book store, which I use for explaining the benefits of stubbing and moching when testing.

The store keeps books which are sold. It has an admin panel for editing/adding books and users and supports purchasing subscriptions for reading books online.

The credit card processing is currently stubbed.

For more info look at the spec directory.
